# FDS-Epi-Project

This machine learning project was a collaboration with Sandia National Labs aimed at predicting COVID-19 hotspots during the early stages of the pandemic. The goal was to enable public health authorities to proactively allocate resources and implement preventative measures such as social distancing and masking. The researchers designed a machine learning classifier using county-level data, incorporating both disease testing and demographic data.


The definition of a "hotspot" was based on the CDC's criteria, classifying areas with high transmission rates. The model considered spatial and temporal factors, acknowledging that the spread of infectious diseases is influenced by human contact and the disease prevalence in neighboring regions.

To ensure the model's reliability, especially for policy-making and national security, the project emphasized the need for trustworthy machine learning techniques. The main computational methods used included the Perceptron algorithm and neural networks, which combined demographic, spatial, and temporal data to forecast potential hotspots up to two weeks in advance.
